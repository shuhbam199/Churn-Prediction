# Churn-Prediction

# 🚖 Ola Driver Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a driver will churn (leave) Ola using historical, demographic, and performance-related data. The goal is to help the organization reduce churn by identifying at-risk drivers and enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Recruiting and retaining drivers is a major challenge for ride-sharing companies like Ola. High driver churn affects:

- Operational stability
- Customer experience
- Driver acquisition cost (which is higher than retention)

By using machine learning, this project predicts **driver churn probability** based on:

- Demographics (e.g., age, gender, education)
- Performance metrics (e.g., ratings, business value)
- Tenure (e.g., date of joining, last working date)
- Behavioral patterns (e.g., income or rating changes)

---

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Imputation**: Missing values handled using KNN imputer.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Change in rating and income over time
  - Flags for improvement in grade/rating
  - Time served in days
- **Models Built**:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest (GridSearch tuned)
  - XGBoost (best performing)
  - LightGBM (fastest, good baseline)
- **Class Imbalance**: Addressed using SMOTE
- **Model Interpretation**: SHAP values used to explain predictions at an individual level
- **Interactive App**: Streamlit frontend for business users to test custom driver profiles

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains ~19,000 driver records with the following fields (subset):

| Column                  | Description                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Age                    | Driver's age                                |
| Gender                 | 0 = Female, 1 = Male                        |
| Income                 | Total income earned                         |
| Joining Designation    | Initial designation at the time of joining |
| Quarterly Rating       | Ola's internal rating of driver             |
| Total Business Value   | Revenue generated by the driver             |
| Last Grade             | Last performance grade                      |
| Churn                  | Target variable (1 = Churn, 0 = Stay)       |

## 🔍 SHAP-based Explainability

The app highlights top features driving churn prediction with direction:
- `↑ Towards Churn` → pushing model to predict churn
- `↓ Away from Churn` → reducing churn risk

Key drivers often include:
- Last Rating
- Change in Rating
- Total Business Value
- Income Increase
